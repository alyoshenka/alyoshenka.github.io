<blockquote>
  <p>‘In Shakti Unleashed, the player will be flying at great speeds while navigating the endless procedurally generated environment around them. It will involve both maneuvering around obstacles as well as firing spells at enemies.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a procedurally generated endless-runner flying game. The player maneuvers a winged character through cloud walls filled with obstacles while being shot at by enemies. The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible to get the highest score.</p>

<p>This game was made by a team of 7 people in just 8 weeks. The team consisted of one designer/producer, three artists, and three programmers, of which I was one. I worked on the player controller, which controls how the player flies through the level, including: what controller buttons correspond to what movements, what movements the player can make, how fast the player can move, what animations play durng what movements, what happens when the player takes damage, how damage is detected on the player. I also worked on the interaction between the player and the environment, which in part consists of what happens when the player runs into the clouds or structures.</p>
